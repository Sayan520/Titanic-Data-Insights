# Titanic-Data-Insights ðŸš¢

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Project Overview

The analysis involves the following steps:
1. **Import Libraries** - Load essential Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Load the Dataset** - Import the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
3. **Perform Data Overview** - Explore basic statistics and gain insights into the data.
4. **Handle Missing Data** - Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values.
5. **Analyze Passenger Data** - Investigate survival rates by gender and class.
6. **Calculate Fare Statistics** - Calculate average, minimum, and maximum fares paid by passengers.
7. **Find Correlations** - Analyze correlations between various features.
8. **Classify Data by Passenger Class** - Explore survival trends across different passenger classes.
9. **Save Cleaned Data** - Export the cleaned dataset to a CSV file.

## Additional Enhancements

- **Data Cleaning Explanation**: A detailed explanation of the data cleaning steps.
- **Visualizations**: Additional box plots to visualize fare and age distributions by survival status.
- **Model Evaluation**: Implementation of cross-validation to ensure more reliable model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The project reveals insightful findings about survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and fare. Notably:
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than lower classes.
- Higher fares were associated with better survival chances.
